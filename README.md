eClinic
====================

    The e-clinic has records of students’ profile with information of his or her medical history and known medical issues. The clinic’s staff nurse can then easily access a certain student’s profile through the application’s search feature. After a consultation the staff nurse can then record the student’s diagnosis and prescription of the drug give if there is any.

    The application can then produce reports through graph of the health trends (statistics of trending cases during consultations) and the health of the overall student body (statistics of the percentage of the number of students who were sick over the number of students in the database).
